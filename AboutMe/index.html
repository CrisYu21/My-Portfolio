        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <!-- Content -->
        <p><strong>I am Cris, a first-year computer engineering student. As an introvert, I often avoid socializing with many people. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by the workings of modern engineering marvels — from computers to cars — that make our lives easier today. At home, my Lola was strict, and I was not allowed to play outside the compound. Instead, I stayed indoors, spending hours disassembling and tweaking things, exploring what was inside them, and putting them back together. I built my own toys and spent so much time working that I only went out when it was time to eat. It was my comfort zone, doing things at home instead of meeting people outside.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>My interests lie in technology, specifically the military and defense industry. As a child, I watched documentaries and movies about technological innovations in these fields, which inspired my love for aviation. I dream of becoming a pilot in the air force someday.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>To fulfill this dream, I chose to pursue a computer engineering degree. This course serves as my stepping stone, not only for flying but also for contributing to science and technology. I aspire to create inventions that benefit not only the scientific community but also industries like military defense. I want to help innovate and push our country towards a brighter future.</strong></p>
